 Gold Roger,the King of the Pirates,
 attained everythingthis world has to offer.
 The words he uttered just beforehis death drove people to the seas.
 My treasure?If you want it, you can have it!
 Find it! I left everythingthis world has to offer there!
 And so men head for theGrand Line in pursuit of their dreams!
 The world has trulyentered a Great Pirate Era!
 We're going to gather upall our dreams
 and set out in searchof something to find
 ONE PIECE!
 Compasses only cause delays
 Delirious with fever,I take the helm
 If the dusty treasure map hasbeen verified, it's not a legend!
 When it comes to personal storms,
 simply ride aboardsomeone else's biorhythm
 and pretend it isn't there!
 We're going to gather upall our dreams
 and set out in searchof something to find
 A coin in my pocket,and do you wanna be my friend?
 We are, We are on the cruise!
 We are!
 Whoa...
 ""I'm Luffy! The Man Who'sGonna be King of the Pirates!""
 No worries!
 A whirlpool of that sizeposes no problem to this ship!
 Miss.
 May I have this dance?
 Alright!
 Not again...
 Batter out!
 What're you doing? You suck!
 This thing's heavy!
 Must be filled with booze, then!
 It's all ours now!
 Ship off the starboard stern!
 There's a pirate flag on its mast!
 It's a pirate ship!Enemy raid! Enemy raid!
 Captain! Pirates!
 What?!
 Everyone, stay calm!
 Stay calm!
 Follow instructionsin a calm manner!
 Fire!
 Coby!
 Y-Yes, ma'am?!
 Who's the most beautifulof all on these seas?
 T-This ship's captain,Alvida-sama, of course!
 Well done!
 T-Thank you!
 Alvida-sama.This is our first prey in a while.
 That's right!
 Alright! Start pounding the ship!
 Men! Show them the terror ofIron Club Alvida, the woman pirate!
 Coby! What're you doing?!
 I-I'm not goodat this sort of thing...
 Hmm?! Are you tryin'to give me backtalk?!
 P-Please, anything but the club!
 Then get yer ass in gear!
 We won't take yer lives, butwe will take all yer valuables!
 Anyone who tries to fight back'llwind up at the bottom of the ocean!
 Hello...
 There's no one in here, right?
 What a relief...
 That's a rather large barrel...
 Who're you?!Never seen you before!
 Hey, coward!
 Are you hidin' out in aplace like this again?!
 N-No! I thought I'd haul thisbig barrel of alcohol over...
 We'll lighten it for ya!
 I was just feelin' thirsty!
 You can't! Alvida-samawill kill us if she finds out!
 Then you just needto keep yer mouth shut!
 Right, Coby?
 Y-Yes! You're right!
 Thing's pretty heavy!
 Can't wait!
 Hold yer horses!I'll bust it right open!
 I slept great!
 Huh?
 Who're you guys?
 No, who are you?!
 That guy's gonna catch coldif he sleeps there, y'know.
 You did that!
 Are you toyin' with us evenwhen you know we're pirates?!
 Man, I'm hungry!You got any food?
 Listen when people are talking!
 You damn kid!
 Die!
 What's the big idea?
 W-Who are you?!
 Me?
 I'm Monkey D. Luffy.Nice to meetcha!
 What the... What just happened?
 What's with them?
 R-Run, hurry! If they come backwith their friends, you'll be killed!
 But man, I sure am hungry!
 How can you be so carefree?!
 There are still lotsmore of them up on deck!
 C'mon! This way!
 H-H-Hey! Not this way!
 Food! Food! Food! Yes! Food!
 Actually, they mightnot find us in here!
 Which should I choose?This box? Ooh, jackpot!
 These look great!
 M-My name is Coby.You're Luffy-san, right?
 That was incredible just now!How did you do that?!
 These things are great!
 Is this a pirate ship?
 No, it's a passenger ship that'sbeing raided by Alvida-sama.
 Well, it doesn't matter.
 Do you know if thereare any boats onboard?
 I-I think so...
 My ship got swallowedby this giant whirlpool...
 You mean that whirlpool?!No one could survive that!
 Boy, was that a real surprise!
 Are you one of those pirates, too?
 It was on that fateful day...
 That day, I got in a boat onthe outskirts of town to go fishing...
 ...but it turned out the boat wasactually headed for a pirate ship.
 It's been two years since...
 In exchange for my life,I've been forced to be a chore boy.
 Man, you're dumb and stupid!
 You're brutally honest...
 If you don't like it, then run away!
 I-I can't! No way! No way!
 Just the thoughtof Alvida-sama finding me...
 ...frightens me and makesme weak in the knees--
 Oh, you're a wimp, too?
 Man, I hate you!
 Hey, now! Quit dawdling!
 Haul it all off beforethe navy gets here!
 Anyone caught dawdlinggets a taste of my iron club!
 --What a haul!--Seems like a pretty rich ship!
 Hey! You'll get the clubif she catches you slackin' off!
 Oh, whoops!
 Yeah, one hit fromthat and you're a goner!
 Alvida-sama!
 It's bad!
 What is it?! You're annoying me!
 A b-b-barrel!
 M-M-Monster!
 Huh?!
 Who're you calling a monster?!
 N-No... Some weird guypopped out of a barrel...
 He might be...a bounty hunter...
 What?!
 Yeah... That's right...
 If only I had the courage todrift the ocean in a barrel...
 ...there's actuallysomething I want to do, too...
 Umm... What compelled youto set out onto the sea, Luffy-san?
 I'm gonna bethe King of the Pirates!
 --K-K-King of the Pirates?!--Yep.
 --Are you serious?!--Yeah.
 Wait, you're a pirate, Luffy-san?!
 Yep.
 What about your crew?!
 Don't got one.I'm just about to look for one.
 K-K-King of the Pirates isthe title given to the person...
 ...who obtains everything in this world!
 That means seeking the greattreasure of wealth, fame, and power...
 ...the One Piece!
 Yup!
 Yup?! Pirates all over theworld are after that treasure!
 Me too!
 No way! No way, no way, no way!Absolutely no way!
 There's no way you can stand atthe apex of this Great Pirate Era!
 No way! No way!
 Why did you hit me?
 Just because.
 But it's all right.I'm used to it now...
 It's not about whether I can or not.
 I'm gonna do it because I want to.
 I've decided to be the King of the Pirates,
 so if I die fighting for that,that's fine with me!
 Now, then! My belly's full--guess I'll go get me a boat!
 I wonder if they'll give me one if I ask.
 Hopefully they're generous.
 I never once thought about it...
 Do you suppose I can do it, too?
 If I'm prepared to die for it?
 Do what?
 Do you think...even I could join the navy?
 Navy?
 Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!
 It's been my dream ever since Iwas little! Do you think I can do it?!
 How should I know?
 No! I'll do it! If I'm gonna be achore boy for the rest of my life,
 then I'll break out of here andcatch even Alvida-sama-- no, Alvida!
 You're gonna team upwith him to catch who?!
 Huh, Coby?!
 You don't seem to be Zoro, the pirate hunter.
 Zoro?
 Coby!
 Who's the most beautifulof all on these seas?!
 O-Of course that would be--
 Who's this big chunky lady?
 --Chunky?--Not good...
 You runt!
 Let's go!
 Why, you...
 Whoops!
 It's not fair to attack from behind!
 It's not fair to attack all at once!
 Gotcha!
 Gum-Gum...
 ...Rocket!
 What?!
 L-Luffy-san... What are you?
 Me?
 I'm a rubber person!
 A rubber person?You can't be serious!
 You've eaten a Devil's Fruit, haven't you?
 Yeah! The Gum-Gum Fruit!
 I see! I'd heard the rumors,but I guess they really do exist!
 You also seem pretty skilled.You a bounty hunter?
 I'm a pirate!
 A pirate?! Hah!All by yourself?!
 It's just me right now, but I'llfind some more sooner or later!
 Yeah... Ten crewmen sounds good to me!
 Ah, so you're a pirate too, huh?!
 Then that means youand me are enemies, huh?
 --L-Luffy-san! Let's get out of here!--Why?
 You saw how powerful her club is!
 In these waters, she's the most--
 I've decided to bethe King of the Pirates,
 so if I die fighting for that,that's fine with me!
 I'm the most what?!
 T-T-The...
 The most ugly,cragged old hag ever!
 What did you say?!
 I... I'm going to join the navy!
 And then I'm gonna beat up pirates!
 Do you even knowwhat you're saying?!
 I do! I'm gonna dowhat I want to do!
 I'm gonna...I'm gonna join the navy...
 ...and catch your lousy ass!
 You damn pipsqueak!
 No regrets! No regrets!I said it! I fought! For my dream!
 Well said!
 That doesn't work!
 What?!
 'Cause I'm rubber!
 Gum-Gum...
 ...Pistol!
 The sky is so blue...
 Hey!
 --Yes?!--Yes?!
 Give Coby a small boat!
 He's gonna join the navy!Keep your mouths shut and let him go!
 --R-Right!--R-Right!
 Luffy-san!
 It's the navy!
 Oh, perfect timing!You should go see 'em!
 But I'm a pirate! I'm outta here!
 Get serious!
 I can't just join the navy like this!
 I'll be captured instead!
 Looks like we managed to get away...
 Whew, that was fun!
 Umm, Luffy-san.
 If you're heading for the One Piece,
 --that means you're goingto the Grand Line, right?--Yeah.
 That place is also referred toas a pirate graveyard, you know.
 Yeah. That's why I need a strong crew.
 What about that pirate hunter guy?What's he like?
 You mean Zoro? I heard he'sbeing held prisoner at a navy base.
 Aw, he's a weakling?
 Nothing of the sort!He's as terrifying as a demon!
 Why are you asking about him?
 Thought I might have him joinmy crew if he's a good guy!
 You're being reckless again!
 C'mon, he might be a good guy!
 He's been caughtbecause he's a bad guy!
 No! No way, no way, no way!Absolutely no--
 Why did you hit me?
 Just because!
 ""To be continued""
 When I was little, I hada vision of a treasure map
 and I always searchedfor that miraculous place
 before someone else couldbeat me to it
 If the world is going to change
 before I can even attain my dream
 then take me to the timewhen I knew nothing
 so that my memories won't fade
 Hey! I'll untie your ropes,so join my crew!
 I refuse to team up with a pirate!
 Oh, come on. You're alreadyknown as an evil bounty hunter.
 Screw that! I ain't done a singlething I regret! And I never will!
 So I ain't gonna be a pirate!
 I've decided you're gonna join me!
 Quit deciding on your own!
 On the next episode of One Piece!
 ""Enter the Great Swordsman!Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro""
 I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

 A coin in my pocket,and do you wanna be my friend?
 We are, We are on the cruise!
 We are!
 What great weather!
 If we keep going this way,
 we should see thenavy base island soon!
 Wow, Coby! You're amazing!
 We're actually gonnareach our destination?
 But of course!
 These are the bareminimum skills all sailors need!
 This is no timeto be laughing, Luffy-san.
 He's being held prisoner there.
 The famous pirate hunter...
 Roronoa Zoro!
 The man who's chopped upbounties like a bloodthirsty beast...
 People say he's ademon in human form!
 ""Enter the Great Swordsman!Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro""
 We made it! The navy base city!
 Seriously, Luffy-san!
 You're crazy to want him to join you!
 I still haven't decided yet.I just wanna see if he's a good guy...
 He's been caughtbecause he's a bad guy!
 Mm! Yum!
 Do you know if Zoro's at the base?
 It would seem the name ""Zoro"" is taboo here...
 Well, let's check out the base anyway.
 You're gonna be a marine, right?
 Y-Yes... But I'm not really ready yet...
 Rumor has it...
 ...a guy namedCaptain Morgan is at this base, and...
 What a funny town!
 It's strange...
 I understand Zoro, but why arethey afraid of a navy captain's name?
 I suddenly feel uneasy about this...
 You sure they didn't jump just for fun?
 Nobody would do that!
 Alright! This's the place!
 I'm finally here!
 I guess this is wherewe part ways, Luffy-san.
 It was only for a short time, but...
 Upsy-daisy!
 Luffy-san! What in the world are you doing?!
 Now where's this demon?!
 He wouldn't be out here.
 I'm sure he's ina prison cell or something...
 There he is!
 Alright!
 See! There he is!
 Yeah, right!He wouldn't be out--
 A black hood and a haramaki...
 That's Roronoa Zoro!
 He can get away easyif we untie those ropes!
 D-Don't be stupid!
 There's no telling what'llhappen if we let him loose!
 I bet he'd try to kill you too, Luffy-san!
 Don't worry! I'm strong!
 I can't believe this guy!
 Hey, you guys.
 You're an eyesore.
 Get lost!
 Luffy-san! There's no way youcould survive with him on your crew!
 Oh no! Stop her, Luffy-san!
 She'll be killed!
 What?
 You must be hungry!I made you some rice balls!
 Do you wanna get killed, pipsqueak? Scram!
 You haven't eaten anything this whole time.
 Here! This is my first time,
 but I worked really hard to make them!
 I ain't hungry!
 You're an eyesore!Get the hell outta here!
 But...
 I don't want 'em!Don't make me kick your ass!
 It's not nice to be a bully!
 You seem surprisingly well, Roronoa Zoro...
 Now there's another weird guy!
 Thank goodness!
 He must be with the navy!Now that girl will be safe!
 Oh? Those are sometasty-looking rice balls.
 Stop!
 Too damn sweet!
 Those're full of sugar!
 You're supposed to use salt for rice balls!
 But I thought theymight taste better sweet...
 --Take this! And this!--Stop! Stop!
 H-How horrible!
 And I worked so hard to make those...
 Did you not read this notice?
 ""Those who helpcriminals will be executed!
 Navy Captain Morgan""
 Looks like even little bratsknow how scary my dad is!
 Dad?
 Then that's Captain Morgan's son?!
 You. Throw this kid out.
 Sir?!
 I said throw her over the wall!
 Or can you not follow my orders?!Don't make me tell my dad!
 Y-Yes, sir! Right away!
 No!
 I-I'm sorry, little girl.Curl yourself into a ball.
 T-Thanks...
 Are you all right, Luffy-san?!
 Are you all right?!
 I can't believe howhorrible that guy is!
 Do you hurt anywhere?
 Damn you...
 You sure are stubborn about staying alive...
 Yeah! I will live the full month!
 Well, good luck with that.
 Ten days left, you know!
 Assuming you can live that long!
 How can he be so cruel, Luffy-san?!
 He's gone?!
 I hear you're a bad guy.
 Are you still here?
 Being stuck out here for all to see...
 Are you really strong at all?!
 Mind your own business!
 If it were me, I'd probablystarve to death in three days!
 I got more spirit than you.
 I will live through this...
 I swear it!
 What a strange person!
 Wait!
 Could you pick that up for me?
 You're gonna eat this?
 It's mostly a mud ball now.
 Just shut up and give it here!
 Told you so.
 It was good.
 Thanks for the food.
 Really?!
 Yeah! He ate every last bite!
 I'm so happy!
 Is Zoro really as evilas the rumors say?
 No!
 After all, he let himselfget crucified in our place...
 Huh? What do you mean?
 It's all that Helmeppo's fault.
 He's Captain Morgan's son...
 Outta the way!
 Make way for my adorable pet-sama!
 Get in the way, and you get executed!
 No! Stop that!
 Hey, you!
 You gonna complain aboutwhat my pet-sama's doin'?!
 Rika! Stop that!
 We'll get in troubleif we go against him!
 --Oh, crap!--He's in trouble now!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Don't tell me you're...
 ...pirate hunter Zoro?
 And if I am?
 Why is a pirate hunter defying the navy?!
 Just shut up and let me eat in peace!
 Why, you...
 You're annoying me.Both you and your pet-sama!
 You do realize that if mydad finds out about this,
 they're gonna getexecuted for sure!
 Whadya say? Let's make a deal!
 You get strung up in placeof this mother and daughter!
 For, yeah, one month...
 If you can survive for one month,
 I'll let you live, too.
 Whadya say?
 One month.
 It's been three weeks since then.
 Helmeppo punches andkicks him while he's tied up!
 I... I...
 I see...
 I'm hungry!Let us all eat for free!
 Hey! Bring me some booze!
 Quit dawdling! Hurry it up!
 Oh, yes.
 I've been bored lately,
 so I've decidedto execute Zoro tomorrow.
 Look forward to it!
 W-What the hell're you doing?!
 Luffy-san! Please stop!
 This guy is scum!
 Y-You hit me!
 I'm Captain Morgan's son, you know!
 So what?!
 I'm gonna tell my dadand he's gonna execute you!
 Fight me yourself!
 Luffy-san! Calm down!
 Are you trying to geton the navy's bad side?!
 I've made up my mind, Coby!
 I'm... going to have Zoro join my crew!
 I am...
 great!
 Yes! You're exactly right,Captain Morgan, sir!
 But hasn't tribute to mebeen a bit lacking lately?
 W-Well, the citizens'wallets do have their limits...
 The issue is the level of respect for me.
 Wouldn't you agree?
 Dad!
 There's someone I want you to slaughter!
 You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!
 I promised her...
 I can't afford to diein a place like this!
 You again?You sure have lots of free time.
 I'll untie you, so join my crew!
 Say what?!
 I'm looking for peopleto join my pirate crew.
 Forget it!Me, stooping to a criminal's level?!
 Screw that!
 What's wrong with being a pirate?!
 Pirates are despicable!As if I'd wanna be one!
 Oh, come on!
 You're already knownas an evil bounty hunter!
 People can say whatever they want,
 but I ain't done anything I regret.
 I will live through thisand accomplish what I want!
 Yeah?
 But I've decided you're gonna join me!
 Quit deciding on your own!
 I hear you use swords.
 Yeah. But that stupid son took my stuff...
 --I'll go get it back for you!--What?!
 So if you want your sword, join my crew!
 You're really getting on my nerves!
 Is he planning to bustinto the base by himself?!
 You idiot! The base isin the other direction!
 Gum-Gum Rocket!
 W-Who the hell is that guy?!
 Alright! Stop there!
 Stand it up in one shot!
 Dad! Why aren't yougoing to get revenge?!
 The guy hit me!
 Not even you've ever hit me in the face!
 Do you know why I've never hit you before?
 Eh? Because you think I'm--
 Yes. Because you're...
 ...a stupid son whoisn't even worth hitting!
 Don't get the wrong idea!
 Your dad is the one who's great! Me!
 Which reminds me, I hear a ratsnuck into the crucifixion yard.
 I-I-If you mean that pipsqueak,I made sure she was dealt with--
 You killed her, I hope?!
 N-No! I mean, she was just a little kid...
 You, there!
 Go into town and exterminate her!
 Y-You can't be serious!She's just a little girl!
 I can't in good conscience...
 Anyone who disobeys myorders is a traitor, even little brats.
 B-But... I can't do it!
 Lieutenant!
 Y-You didn't have to go that far!
 It was with my strength thatI rose to my rank of captain!
 Listen! In this world,titles mean everything!
 That means that I, the captain andhighest ranking officer at this base,
 am the most superior person here!
 So everything I do is right!
 Isn't that right, you guys?!
 Yes, sir!You're absolutely correct!
 The kid's death can wait for now.
 Observe! This is the symbol of my authority,
 which took many years to finally complete!
 Now, stand it up!
 Display my greatnessat the top of this base!
 That's weird.There's no one here...
 I gotta find that stupid sonand get Zoro's sword back.
 Pull! Pull!
 You, there!
 You bumped it, didn't you?!
 I heard something up there...
 I-I'm sorry, sir! I was careless!
 I told you to thinkof this statue as me!
 The slightest scratch or speckof dirt is treachery against me!
 I'll just check it out!
 Gum-Gum...
 ...Rocket!
 Now you pay!
 I jumped too far!
 --What is that?!--It flew up from below!
 I stopped!
 Sorry...
 Seize him!I'm going to kill him!
 Yes, sir! Right away!
 Dad! That's him!He's the guy who hit me!
 Oh! It's you!
 I've been looking for you!
 Come with me!There's something I want you to give back!
 --Let me go!--Helmeppo-sama!
 After him! Don't let him escape!
 Captain! There's someonein the crucifixion yard!
 What?!
 It's one traitor after the other...
 After him! After him!
 Hurry!
 Someone just had to interrupt...
 Where is Zoro's sword?!
 I'll tell you! I'll tell you!Just stop dragging me!
 Alright! Talk!
 In my room...We just passed it...
 What? Why didn't you say so?Now we gotta go back.
 --Freeze!--Let Helmeppo-sama go!
 No.
 Go ahead and shoot, if you dare!
 No! Don't!
 Please escape, Zoro-san!
 You'll be killed for doing that, you know!
 I can't stand to watchthe navy like this anymore.
 I want to bean honorable marine!
 Stop! I can't escape!I only got ten days until--
 You're going to beexecuted tomorrow!
 What?!
 Helmeppo never onceintended to honor your agreement!
 So Luffy-san got angry and punched him!
 He did?
 The navy is after Luffy-san now.
 I won't ask you to be a pirate.
 But please, help Luffy-san!
 Luffy-san is the onlyone who can save you.
 And I think you're also the onlyone who can save Luffy-san now.
 End of the line!
 For the crime of treachery against me,
 I'll now execute you two where you stand!
 This the room?!
 Bingo!
 But there are three here!
 Hey! Which sword is Zoro's?
 Oh, he passed out.
 Coby!
 This is some interestingstuff you guys've pulled!
 Were you two and that straw hatkid plannin' a coup or something?!
 I've always fought alone.
 Unlike arrogant bastards likeyou who use soldiers as cronies!
 Roronoa Zoro...
 Don't you dare underestimate me!
 You may be strong,
 but before my authority,you're as good as scum!
 Aim!
 I...
 ...can't afford to die here!
 You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!
 Gum-Gum...
 ...Rocket!
 Fire!
 --What are you--?!--Luffy-san!
 Straw Hat?!
 That doesn't work!
 I told you I was strong!
 W-Who the hell are you?!
 I'm Monkey D. Luffy!
 The man who's gonnabe King of the Pirates!
